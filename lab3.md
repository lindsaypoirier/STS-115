## Instructions and Overview

This week you are going to do some background research on the dataset
that you will be primarily working with throughout the quarter. As we
are learning in our reading of *The Fires*, it is important that we
understand how the datasets we analyze get produced, who produced them,
what they are designed to represent (and also what they might ignore),
and what socio-political contexts might affect what their scope.

As you respond to these questions, you should be sure to examine the
data documentation, the web source where you retreived the data, the
website of the organization that collected or published the data, and
any laws/press releases/news articles that reference the data. **All
responses should be in your own words, and be sure to cite all
sources.** You most likely will not be able to answer all questions
below. This is OK. If cannot find an answer to a question, please
describe the steps you took to try and find the
answer.
